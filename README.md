Simple crawler written in Go.

## Known issues and problems
- The user must specify both the format and the file arguments to save what crawler finds to a file. 
- Some urls can broke the crawler due to the lack of sanity checking of the urls.
- The source code isn't broken into different directories/modules.
- **The source code isn't quite DRY and KISS, but I'll try to make it like this .**
*** I will fix all of this later. ***
